## Description

The task is to slice the design seen above. 
You can download the psd file here: https://cloud.emakina.com/index.php/s/3ANC2XCvEwk8IKy.

The following browsers need to be supported:
* Firefox (latest pc/mac)
* Chrome (latest pc/mac)
* Internet Explorer 11
* Edge.

The page should be responsive, no design for other breakpoints is foreseen, feel free to show your artistic side.
The only requirement is that you have to show the icons inside the navigation on all screen sizes.

The first section contains a slider with 3 images.
Only the images change, not the text.

Form validation is optional, but not required.

Clicking on the CTA, should show the next step of the form.

**When you're done, upload it!**

## Notes

* Use whatever tool or library you want
* Keep the code clean and reviewable.
* Keep the Src files (Scss)
